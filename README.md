# Customer Churn Analysis 📉

This is a Capstone Project based on the **Customer Churn dataset** from the telecom industry. The aim is to understand and predict customer churn using Python and various ML models.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement:
The telecom company "Neo" is losing its customers. This project explores the reasons behind churn and builds predictive models to help reduce customer losses.

## 📂 Tasks Performed

### 🔸 A) Data Manipulation
- Extracted specific columns and filters (senior citizens, payment method, churn status etc.)
- Filtered based on tenure and monthly charges
- Generated random samples
- Churn value counts

### 🔸 B) Data Visualization
- Bar Plot for `InternetService`
- Histogram for `tenure`
- Scatter plot between `MonthlyCharges` & `tenure`
- Box plot between `Contract` and `tenure`

### 🔸 C) Linear Regression
- `MonthlyCharges` as dependent, `tenure` as independent
- Train/test split (70:30)
- RMSE and error calculation

### 🔸 D) Logistic Regression
- Binary model: `Churn` vs `MonthlyCharges`
- Multiple model: `Churn` vs `tenure` & `MonthlyCharges`
- Train/test split with confusion matrix and accuracy

### 🔸 E) Decision Tree
- Model: `Churn` vs `tenure` with confusion matrix

### 🔸 F) Random Forest
- Model: `Churn` vs `tenure` & `MonthlyCharges`
